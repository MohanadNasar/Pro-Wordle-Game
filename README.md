# Pro-Wordle-Game

<h3>Project Description</h3>

<h5>In this project, i was tasked with implementing a modified version of the game Wordle, referred to as Pro-Wordle, using Prolog. Pro-Wordle consists of two main phases: </h5>

Knowledge Base Building Phase: During this phase, players are prompted to input words along with their respective categories. Facts are added to the knowledge base using the predicate word/2, where word(W, C) is true if word W is associated with the category C. This phase continues until the player enters "done."

Gameplay Phase: Following the KB building phase, the Pro-Wordle game transitions into the gameplay phase. In this phase, players are presented with a challenge word and must guess its category. Your Prolog implementation uses the knowledge base to evaluate the guess and provide feedback. The game continues until the correct category is identified.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
Prolog: The project is implemented using the Prolog programming language, showcasing the use of logic programming for creating word games and knowledge-based systems.
The choice of Prolog as the primary technology highlights the effectiveness of logical reasoning in game development and knowledge representation, particularly in the context of word games like Pro-Wordle.
